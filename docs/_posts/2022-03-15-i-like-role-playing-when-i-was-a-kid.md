i like role playing when i was a kid.

The bed with the smooth, static-prone bed linen, the *bumpy* ceiling with a blinking lamp in the center, this 20-square cubic space make up the whole context. Sometimes i can stay for hours just by, starting a conversation with "someone (might be an oppose force)", and then diving into the story with no script at all.

Usually he/she needs me to save him/her over a set of difficulties, i could be capable of Kung Fu simply because the plastic *golden cudgel* (a weapon used by the monkey king in the novel pilgrimage to the west 《西遊記》) asides the pillow, and i act as the monkey trapped under the 5 finger *pillow mountain*. Use whatever "weapon" around and make the plot goes on is, natural.

The ceiling is more fun. Because i was hardly sleep at night alone (at the moment i was attached to my mom and not an independent type while parents wanted me to practice "sleeping alone," or "the independent thing"), so i kept my eyes open staring at the ceiling letting my mind/fear go nowhere. i was always imagining there is a world with *my ceiling as their floor*, and there could be a way to enter the upside down world somehow.

The *radiator* is a mystery because of its wooden shutter-like enclosure, you can barely see what's inside and many of my [small fry](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNDAzMzkzMQ==&mid=2649698952&idx=5&sn=365501402cb3914f55a26341fd9a1ca1&scene=21#wechat_redirect) got lost or were drawn into its darkness. i wondered it was the tunnel until one day i found all my missing *Toy rubbers* in its corner surrounding dust and cobweb.

***yes the radiator is (the tunnel),i confirmed.***

Oh…one more thing, you know why the ceiling is not considered the sky? Because when i grow tall enough, I could stand on my bed punching the sky with my little fist, i don’t think the sky should be like this. (Apparently Pangu Separates the Sky from the Earth is not relevant to the plot）

So it is considered the floor at that world, though i haven't found a way to earth it.

# On lock down Day 1

During an unexpected lock down, I think of a writing challenge on whatever i feel like writing at the moment i woke up in the morning, in English. The fun part is, i could think of words (verbs, nouns, adjectives etc) in Chinese and find the words accordingly in English, and then structure sentences around them. Certain *harmony or even symphony*was evoked in my mind while the words organizing themselves.

Today’s piece is about a dream i had yesterday, where i captured the ceiling from my childhood home.
