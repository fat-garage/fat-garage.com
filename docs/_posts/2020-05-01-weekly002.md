*  关于HZ HACK的讨论总结

 

**Daniel**：

 

I think some idea along the lines of connecting communities between China and New Zealand through Sylo experience for an Agile workshop can be epic

 

I think we can define the topic broadly as : coping mechanism for challenging times. Weave into it the digital interaction for collaboration and the wellbeing practices

 

**Gurleen**：

 

**Idea 1**：**A platform for People to share stories and react to stories,esp for COVID-19**

 

Right now the implementation in my mind looks like a platform much like Twitter, where individuals and business can voice their personal experience. But it will be more than Twitter, since it is purpose built for this crises.

 

Coming out of a crises people need to grieve. Perhaps a way for people to grieve together? People to share stories and react to stories. But what if we went a step further and had the feel that all the crowd-source funding platforms give. What if people could, based on resonance of a particular story could donate time/resources/money via the platform too?

 

Meaning a platform which not only allows and promotes storytelling but also a way to act on it.

 

**Idea 2**：**Work giver and taker platform between NZ and CN using Sylo**

 

One of the three sectors is 'connecting community'.

 

There is a need for a platform for people that need help (work_givers) to be matched with people that have time/ need work (work_takers). Simply a matching system, leveraging sylo's user-base could be a reasonable solution to the community problem. As a simple case- you could match people that need groceries with those that can deliver them and pay all through the app.

 

There's many applications we could think about with this sylo sdk..

 

i guess maybe this can envolve crypto in payment ;)

 

**Jessie**：

 

M thinking of what online stuff we can do to leverage both sides advantages . It’s funny that recently my friend got an online translation work , it’s like a lot of case study materials from a NZ company ,which need to be translated into Mandarin . So  i was thinking ,also like Singh said,will there be opportunities in the WORK matching ? Those easy to proof-of-work and also a great way for ppl to know more about NZ (China).

 

In terms of Online mini workshop,m thinking could we build a Online MEETUP (or something like that) especially for NZ and China, I heard from Daniel that NZ is so awesome in Community building/Story telling/mental health and well-being etc,I guess that’s exactly what we(Chinese) are not good at,and people gradually realize that they need.

 

And also,there should be something that NZ need and  CN is good at.
